# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Purpose of this project is to review Theater Outcomes by Lauch Date and the Outcomes based on Goals. 
To analyst the data by measuring certain characteristics.


## Analysis and Challenges

The challenges I faced was when reviewing the data and the imgaes provided in Module...nothing was adding up. 
I thought it was my formula, however, after filtering to review my data, everything is right within my end.
 
## Results

**1. What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
	- You will notice, the trend line is going down as a whole. Meaning there are less projects being done. 
	- Looks like within Spring, we had a good number of projects and a high success rate. 

**2. What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**
	- There are more projects between the gaol of $1,000 to $4,999. Anything over $50,000 you have a 17% chance of succedding. 

**3. What are some limitations of this dataset?**
	- Personally speaking, I don't see a limitation. This gives you everything about the Kickstarter projects. When it started, the goal, the pledged, the number of people who dodnated, when it ended.

**4. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**
	- I created this just to see. I created a Outcomes based on Lauch Date to see how active the donations/proejcts are by the Year and Month. 
		- Measuring everything as a whole, over the years starting from 2014 to 2017, Kickstarts have been dropping. I added a trendline linear to measure to future forecast.
		- As a seasonal trend, within Fall (Aug., Sep., Oct.), the success and fail rates are close to being similar. It also represent within Fall, there are little projects being posted.
