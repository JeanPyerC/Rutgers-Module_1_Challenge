# Rutgers-Module_1_Challenge
Module 1 challenge, analyzing Starter Book data. 
## Overview of Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purpose of this project is to review the theater outcomes by Launch Date and the outcomes based on goals. To analyst the data by measuring certain characteristics in order to tell a story. Doing so we are able to view Amazing Data,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By viewing the *Theater Outcomes by Lauch Date*, you can view many things about the image. The data shows that during the spring, we have a high number of Succesful startups, and a high number of people participating. You can also see a the data points declining after spring. This could be considered a seasonal trend, meaning during the spring we have a high number of kickstarters, however during the winter or fall, we have a low number.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By viewing *Outcomes based on Goal*, you can view the number of success rates based on goals. For example, if your goal is above $25,000, you have a small chance in achieving your goal. IF your goal is below $25,000, you have a better chance in achieving your goal. This can be a useful tool when looking into trendsto help clients achieve their goal.
