# Rutgers-Module_1_Challenge
## Overview of Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purpose of this project is to review the theater outcomes by Launch Date and the outcomes based on goals. To analyst the data by measuring certain characteristics in order to tell a story. Doing so we are able to view Amazing Data,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By viewing the *Theater Outcomes by Lauch Date*, you can view many things about the image. The data shows that during the spring, we have a high number of Succesful startups, and a high number of people participating. You can also see a the data points declining after spring. This could be considered a seasonal trend, meaning during the spring we have a high number of kickstarters, however during the winter or fall, we have a low number.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By viewing *Outcomes based on Goal*, you can view the number of success rates based on goals. For example, if your goal is above $25,000, you have a small chance in achieving your goal. IF your goal is below $25,000, you have a better chance in achieving your goal. This can be a useful tool when looking into trendsto help clients achieve their goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The challenges I faced was when reviewing the data and the imgaes provided in thr Module...nothing was adding up. I thought it was my formula, however, after filtering the data to review, everything was looking right within my graph. The best thing to do before applying your formula to other sets of data, manually filter the column to make sure your formula is corresponding to the result you need. 

## Results
**1. What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**  
  - You will notice, the trend line is going down as a whole. Meaning there are less projects being done.  
  - Looks like within Spring, we had a good number of projects and a high success rate. 


**2. What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**  
  - There are more projects between the gaol of $1,000 to $4,999. Anything over $50,000 you have a 17% chance of succedding. 

**3. What are some limitations of this dataset?**  
  - Personally speaking, I don't see a limitation. This gives you everything about the Kickstarter projects. When it started, the goal, the pledged, the number of people who dodnated, when it ended.  
  
  **4. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**
  - I created this just to see. I created a Outcomes based on Lauch Date to see how active the donations/proejcts are by the Year and Month.  
    - Measuring everything as a whole, over the years starting from 2014 to 2017, Kickstarts have been dropping. I added a trendline linear to measure to future forecast.  
    - As a seasonal trend, within Fall (Aug., Sep., Oct.), the success and fail rates are close to being similar. It also represent within Fall, there are little projects being posted.
